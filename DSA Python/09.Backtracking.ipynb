    "1. Iterative Approach\n",
    "* In the iterative method, we start from an empty set and progressively build subsets, combinations, or permutations by adding elements one at a time.\n",
    "* For subsets: Each element has two choices: include or exclude. You can think of this as generating all binary masks from `0` to `2^N −1` and using each mask to create a subset.\n",
    "* For permutations: We can use a loop to swap elements, progressively filling each position.\n",

    "3. Lexicographic Generation with Bitmasking\n",
    "* This method is based on generating all binary numbers from  `0` to `2^N −1`. \n",
    "* Each number corresponds to a unique subset by treating the binary digits as a mask (1 means the element is included, 0 means excluded). \\\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. It simplifies the problem since generating binary numbers is straightforward.\n",
    "2. The output is lexicographically sorted when the input is sorted.\n",
    "3. Easy to verify completeness, as all binary masks are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Bitmasking is Ideal for Interviews?\n",
    "* The bitmasking approach is ideal for problems where subsets or combinations are required, as it uses binary representation to simplify the problem and avoids recursion.\n",
    "* Additionally, it outputs solutions in lexicographical order when the input list is sorted, which is a common requirement."
