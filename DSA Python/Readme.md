## STACK 1 
### 1. Array

   a. RAM (Random Access Memory)
   * Ram is Measured in bytes, 1 Byte = 8 bits and bit is a digit 0 or 1, so basically ram help to store the advance data sructure.
   * Integer stores in for of bytes, and 1 integer = 4 Bytes or 32 bits.
   * Ram 2 parts, Values and Address (Bytes). Ex Values: 1, 3, 5 and Its Adress: $0, $4 , $8.
   * Character takes only 1 byte (ASCII Characters).

   b. Arrays and its Properties
   
   **Static Array**
   * Array store in continous store of data
   * 2 parts: 
     * Reading(reach there using for loop to index)
     *  Writing (The size to be fixed, and operation is  `O(1)`). (this can be done easily by Index)
   * Disadvantage of Array (Static Array): . In Static araay you cannot delete the data, can only overwrite the values. *Not observed in python and Java
   * To put the value in middle, you have to move/shift every values in array on different array. (Cannot be done on same array)

   **Dynamic Array**
   * The problme solved here is fixed size and also here pusing, poping and shifiting at the end of the value, all will be `O(n)`
   * Here to get new array just mutiply it by earlier intizalise a new array.
   * We can deallocate the original array, when modifies the array.
   * Amortise Time Complexity will be `O(1)`.

   * Bit-O-Time of Static and Dynamic is same

   **Stacks**
   * Stack supports 3 operations Pop, Push and Peek/Top (Dynamcic array also have this)
   * Stack is also an array, Stack treats as vertical. (top is end kinda bucket)
   * Pop can happend only at the end (reversed way of pushed, pop goes like)
   * LIFO - Last In First Out DS.
   * Monotonic Increasing / Decreasing Based Questions
   * Stack Parenthesis Questions
   * Implementation-type Problems
   * Advanced Stack Problems (merge interval)
   * [General Approach to Stack Problems](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/3168516/A-general-approach-to-stack-problems-in-C%2B%2B-or-Generic-Template)

   **Prefix Sums**
   * In prefix, the values on which index we are including, we will consider value of that index + pre sum.
   * Example, to calculate the sum of subarray, Navie way will be `O(n)`. Using Prefix sum, in between values from (n to m) we can get the prefix of (m) - prefix of (n-1) its O(1).
   
   ``` python
   Class PrefixSum:
      def __init__(self,nums):
         self.prefix = []
         total = 0
         for n in nums:
            total += n
            self.prefix.append(total)
      
      def rangeSum(self, left, right):
         preRight = self.preficx[right]
         preLeft = self.prefix[left-1] if left >0 else 0
         return (preRight - preLeft)
   ```
   * handle this on extreme left on prefix

   **Two Pointers**
   * Two pointes example - Left and Right,  

  **Approaches from python**
   1. functions () \
         1.1. lambda function - its act like a function just a small version of def() `lambda x: x * 2` \
         1.2. map() - 
 
     
   
### 2. Hash

   **Hash Usage**
   * Hash Map is good with TC of `O(1)` in Insert, Remove and Search. But the biggest disadvantage is they don't have any order and their ordering on bases of Key TC is O(NlogN).
   * Use case of Hash Map: create dict type data store , then for loop and within it if consition if name is not in then dict. (python doesn't have special Hash thing so use dict) O(N)
   * [HashSets and HashTables in Python](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/hashsets-and-hashtables-in-python)

 **Hashing**

   | Operation | Time Complexity |
   |-----------|-----------------|
   | search()  | O(1)            |
   | insert()  | O(1)            |
   | remove()  | O(1)            |

### 3. Strings

- `ord('c') - ord('a')`: to get the count number from s
- `char(97+number)`: to get the small letter and 65 for capital letters  
- list of words: can be sorted using : `sorted(words, key=len)`
- Some text book concepts for string matching:

  * Sorting using function - solved questions in greedy notebook

- Using sorted function in string
  - When sorting the list strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"] using the sorted() function, Python will sort the strings lexicographically (dictionary order).

  - Explanation:
The strings are compared character by character in order.
If the characters are equal, the next character is compared until a difference is found, or one string is exhausted.
For strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]:
 flight comes before flow because fli is lexicographically smaller than flo.
flow comes before flower because flow is a prefix of flower.
Result:
    ```python
    strs = sorted(["flower", "flow", "flight"])
    # Output:
    ['flight', 'flow', 'flower']
    ```

### Binary Search

## STACK 2 

### Trees

### DFS and BFS

### Recursion (Backtracking, Graphs, DP and more)

* [On Backtracking about Maze](https://sulugar1.tripod.com/games/maze/mazes.htm)
  * Unlike the simple recursion examples we had encountered, a backtracking procedure goes **through multiple winding and unwinding stages** as it loops through the choices it has to make at every node. 
  * One of the most common applications of backtracking is in the evaluation of moves for strategy games like chess. We will look at a much simpler game, tic-tac-toe, and see how a backtracking strategy can be used to ensure that we can never lose the game.
  * Maze 
     - ![maze](Maze.png)
  * You can use backtracking when you need to find all or some solutions to a problem that meets certain constraints, and the search space is too large or complex to use brute force or greedy methods. Backtracking is useful when: 
    * The problem involves exploring multiple possibilities 
    * You need to find all solutions or the best solution under constraints 
    * Choices must be made in sequence, and each choice depends on previous ones 
    * The solution to a problem does not have a time limit 
  * Backtracking is not regarded as an optimal problem-solving technique. It's not efficient for problems that have many solutions or require a lot of backtracking steps. In such cases, you may need to use other techniques. 
  * Backtracking can be used to solve problems such as Sudoku, N-queens, subset sum, and Hamiltonian cycle.

#### Problem Space of Permutations, Combinations, and Subsets

- **Permutations**: $( N! ) (for ( N )$ elements), generate all possible arrangements of elements.

- **Combinations**: $( C(N, k) = \frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!} )$ (choose \( k \) elements from \( N \)), focus on selecting a specific number of elements from a larger set.

- **Subsets**: $( 2^N )$ (since each element can either be included or excluded from the subset), generate all possible combinations of a set of elements (including the empty set).

* **Iterative, recursive/backtracking, and lexicographic generation (bitmasking)** are the three main strategies, each suited for different scenarios. [InDetail Read NoteBook](09.Backtracking.ipynb)


### Heaps

   | Operation | Time Complexity |

   | insert()  | O(log n)         |
   | remove()  | O(log n)         |
   | heapify() | O(n)            |
* adding value on heap in one go is `O(logn)`
* adding value on heap one a time (like thru some operations the value results) is `O(nlogn)`

### Dynamic Programming

* Fiboonacci number - instance of DP

  * While solving recusion problem, first approach brute force, then add memoization to it and second approach is bottom up.
  * True DP is Bottom up and partial considered memoization
  
* Approach to solve prblems Dynamic programming problem :
1. Check if we can create the decision tree
2. Check if we can create the memoization table
3. Use it for creating bottom up DP

  ### Log(N)

Code has **O(log(n))** time complexity when the number of operations decreases logarithmically as the size of the input, \( n \), increases. This typically happens when the input size is repeatedly divided by a constant factor in each step. Below are common scenarios where the time complexity is \( O(\log(n)) \):

1. **Binary Search**
   - **Scenario**: Searching for an element in a sorted array by dividing the search space into two halves at each step.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def binary_search(arr, target):
         left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
         while left <= right:
             mid = (left + right) // 2
             if arr[mid] == target:
                 return mid
             elif arr[mid] < target:
                 left = mid + 1
             else:
                 right = mid - 1
         return -1
     ```
   - **Reason**: Each iteration cuts the problem size in half, leading to \( \log_2(n) \) steps.

2. **Balanced Binary Search Tree (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees)**
   - **Scenario**: Insertions, deletions, or lookups in a balanced binary search tree.
   - **Reason**: The height of the tree is \( O(\log(n)) \), so operations requiring traversal (like search or insert) scale logarithmically with the number of nodes.


3. **Heap Operations**
   - **Scenario**: Insertions or deletions in a binary heap (e.g., priority queue).
   - **Reason**: Adjustments (heapify-up or heapify-down) traverse the height of the heap, which is \( O(\log(n)) \).


4. **Exponentially Growing or Reducing Loops**
   - **Scenario**: A loop that doubles or halves a value in each iteration.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     n = 100
     while n > 0:
         print(n)
         n //= 2
     ```
   - **Reason**: The loop runs approximately \( \log_2(n) \) times because \( n \) is halved at each step.


5. **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**
   - **Scenario**: Algorithms that split the problem into smaller subproblems in each step, but only solve one subproblem.
   - **Example**: Binary search, Euclid's algorithm for GCD.
   - **Reason**: The problem size reduces geometrically, leading to \( O(\log(n)) \) complexity.


6. **Iterative Algorithms with Exponential Growth**
   - **Scenario**: Doubling the counter or index variable in each iteration.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     i = 1
     while i < n:
         print(i)
         i *= 2
     ```
   - **Reason**: The loop iterates \( \log_2(n) \) times because \( i \) grows exponentially.

 **Summary**
Any process that repeatedly divides or multiplies the input size by a constant factor is likely to have \( O(\log(n)) \) time complexity. Typical applications include:
- Search algorithms (e.g., binary search).
- Data structure operations (e.g., heaps, balanced trees).
- Divide and conquer strategies.
- Iterative loops with exponential growth or reduction.
